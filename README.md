# MapDash
Time management dashboard showing travel times to frequented destinations and linked google calendar events. 

I built this app with the desire to have a personalized digital "planner". My intention for the final version of this will be all of the day's tasks and infromation layed out as to be completely understood at a glance.



## getting started
A Google Maps API key is needed to run the app. https://developers.google.com/maps:

Once you have the API key you can insert it [In the API Controller](https://github.com/AJamesonan/MapDash/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingdojo/controller/APIController.java) in place of API_KEY 
do the same in the first iframe element in the [View](https://github.com/AJamesonan/MapDash/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/dash.jsp)
(it appears twice in the controller and once in the dash.jsp)
